# Honda Canada CUV Homepage concept redesign

This project was a concept redesign for Honda Canada's Certified Used Vehicles homepage. The focus was on crafting a modern, engaging experience that communicates the value and trustworthiness of certified pre-owned vehicles while aligning with Honda's brand identity. Because the original design was tailored for WordPress, I reconstructed the layout with mainly Bootstrap, custom classes and JavaScript.

# Key Features
- Scrollable cards and subtle hover effects create an engaging and interactive user experience
- A selection of featured certified vehicles is showcased with images highlighting the benefits of choosing Certified Pre-Owned
- The design adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for a consistent experience
- Sections are structured to guide users from program overview to benefits and actions, ensuring clarity and readability
- Honda's color palette and visual style are consistently applied throughout the design
